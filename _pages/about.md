# Why

There are a lot of issues in AI ethics spanning issues of organizational challenges, technical tradeoffs, societal implications, culture, context, and more which sometimes slow down progress in the field. I am offering my time to those in the community who don't have access to expertise within their communities and organizations and to those who want to bounce ideas. 

# How

Through a series of conversations (hosted virtually) 1:1 with those who are interested, I am seeking to help the community understand some of the shared challenges we all face and to give us comfort in knowing that we are not alone in facing these issues. 

# What

The current format is a 25-minutes session 1:1 with [me](https://atg-abhishek.github.io) where you can ask any questions that you have on the subject and I'll share what I know to help address those challenges. The abstractions and themes that emerge from these conversations will be shared here on this website for all who want to benefit from these insights.
