A warm welcome to all who have landed here from various places around the internet. 

Good to see you here! 

The purpose of this space is to host community insights that would typically happen in friendly exchanges that yield meaningful solutions to some of the toughest challenges that we face in the field today. 

From experience, I've found it useful to have a curious mind and welcoming ear helping me reason through some tough challenges. _But this can often be hard when you don't have an existing network and a lack of access to resources where you can embark on this._ Sometimes, there are problems with having a safe space to have these discussions as well. 

My goal with this series is to help address these issues and provide you with viewpoints spanning industry and civil society through my work and involvement in the field over the past few years. My advice comes from having worked with many partners and organizations who have struggled with issues that range from organizational changes to minute technical details in tooling. 

I hope that you will join me on this journey as I help you and others in the community but at the same time learn from you to create more meaningful conversations and resources for our community to grow and achieve our goals of building ethical, safe, and inclusive AI systems. 

The format of the session will be a 25-minutes conversation on Saturday noon ET for which you can sign up [here](https://forms.gle/EArTEAfP3dvUCDov5). 

I look forward to hearing from you soon!
